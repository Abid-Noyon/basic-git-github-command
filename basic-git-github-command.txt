Proccess to add or contribute on others code
write code
commit changes
pull request
write more code
commit changes
push changes
make pull request
git pull name of the branch

Making new braches for future update to main /master braches or to work together
git branch
git checkout -b name-of-a-new-branch
git checkout master   use to swith from different braches and edit
git diff name-of-a-new-branch  to see difference among different branches
q to get out 
git push form feature branch
git push --set-upstream origin future-index-update
git push -u origin future-index-update
git branch -d future-index-update delete any branch after compleation
git diff branch name to see defference
git merge main or master which branch you want to merge after that push it to the master or main branch then onwer will see and add it to the main branch
git commit -am "add hello world" only modified file will be added and commit at the same time this is a shortcut
git reset README.md to reset a modified file before commit
git reset HEAD~1 to undo last commit
git log to see all commits
git reset 9a31c957e988892e32da32d30b7561ebd2aa7ace this number is a commit, you can find it on git log and use it to reset any commit
git reset --hard 9a31c957e988892e32da32d30b7561ebd2aa7ace like this git reset --hard commit-number  you can completely remove that commit from your local machine

Some tips
Fork in GitHub

Fork is used to send a request to get access to the repository and make some changes 
After getting access to a repository you can edit any thing and send a poll request to the owner of the repository 
If the owner think its a good change that make the code work better then the owner can add your changes to the main branches or what everever their master or main branch is

This proccess is very useful when a team work together for a project
everyone make changes to the code and master takes decision what code to keep 
That make the work fluent.


Thanks for reading and giving your precious time. I hope this will help you to start your coding journey.
# I will update this command time to time
Thank you
